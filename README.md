### Predicting Tesla's Closing Prices

Predicting stock prices, like Tesla's (NYSE: TSLA), is a complex task that combines financial indicators, market sentiment, and historical data. Python's Yahoo API scraping plays a crucial role in this process:

**1. Historical Data Analysis**

By scraping historical closing prices and volume data, analysts can identify trends, patterns, and potential correlations that influence Tesla's stock performance. This historical context is fundamental for predictive modeling.

**2. Sentiment Analysis Integration**

Python's Yahoo API can be used to gather news headlines related to Tesla. Sentiment analysis techniques, such as VADER, can assess the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) and compound scores of these headlines. Correlating this sentiment data with stock price movements helps gauge the impact of media coverage on Tesla's stock.

**3. Machine Learning Models**

Python provides a wide range of machine learning libraries for building predictive models. Combining historical data, sentiment analysis results, and machine learning models enables analysts to create robust predictive models for Tesla's stock prices.

### Time Series Modeling, LINE-M Assumptions, & Use Cases

**LINE-M Assumptions:**

Time series modeling relies on the LINE-M assumptions:

- **L:** Linearity - Assumes that relationships between variables are linear.
- **I:** Independence - Assumes that observations are independent of each other.
- **N:** Normality - Assumes that residuals (the difference between predicted and actual values) are normally distributed.
- **E:** Equal Variance - Assumes that residuals have constant variance.
- **M:** Mean Zero - Assumes that residuals have a mean of zero.

When these assumptions are not met, advanced modeling techniques are required to correct for these issues.

Advantages of Time Series Modeling:

- **Trend and Seasonality Detection:** Time series models can capture underlying trends and seasonal patterns, which are common in financial data.
- **Prediction:** These models enable the prediction of future values based on historical observations.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Time series analysis can identify repeating patterns and cycles.
- **Interpretability:** Results are often interpretable, allowing for actionable insights.

Disadvantages of Time Series Modeling:

- **Complexity:** Building accurate time series models can be complex and require domain expertise.
- **Assumption Sensitivity:** Violation of LINE-M assumptions can lead to inaccurate predictions.
- **Data Quality:** Models are sensitive to data quality, and missing or erroneous data can affect results.
- **Limited Factors:** Time series models often consider only historical data, ignoring external factors that may influence stock prices.

**Use Cases:**

Time series modeling is suitable for short-term stock price prediction, trend analysis, and identifying cyclical patterns. However, it may not capture long-term structural changes in financial markets.

### Combining Time Series Modeling with Other Techniques

While time series modeling provides valuable insights, it can be enhanced by combining it with other machine learning techniques. For example:

- **Feature Engineering:** Additional features, such as technical indicators or economic data, can complement time series models.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combining the predictions of time series models with those of ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting can improve accuracy.
- **Deep Learning:** Neural networks, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, can capture complex patterns in financial data.

In conclusion, Python's Yahoo API scraping offers accessibility and convenience in collecting financial data, making it a powerful tool for predicting stock prices like Tesla's. When integrated with sentiment analysis and time series modeling, it provides a holistic approach to understanding and forecasting stock behavior. While time series modeling has its advantages and limitations, its combination with other techniques can enhance predictive accuracy and provide valuable insights for investors and analysts in the dynamic world of stock markets.


# [Research Approach](#section-title)

- This research encompasses several time series modeling techniques of varying complexity to analyze and forecast sequential data. Time series modeling is essential in the domain of financial analysis, such as predicting stock prices. Here, we'll delve into several types of time series modeling, each with its unique approach and use cases:

1. **Naive Forecast**: The simplest method involves assuming that future values will be the same as the most recent observation. While straightforward, it often underperforms more sophisticated models due to its inability to capture trends and seasonality.

2. **Historic Mean of the Training Data**: This approach sets future values to the mean of past observations. It's marginally more advanced than the naive forecast but still lacks the ability to account for changing trends or seasonality.

3. **Simple Exponential Smoothing**: Here, a weighted average of past observations is calculated, with more recent data given greater importance. It's useful for data with no seasonality or trend. However, it might struggle with more complex patterns.

4. **Holt-Winters' (Additive and Multiplicative)**: This model extends simple exponential smoothing by considering trends and seasonality. Additive Holt-Winters' assumes constant seasonality, while multiplicative Holt-Winters' assumes seasonality proportional to the level of the series. These models are valuable for capturing both trend and seasonality in data.

5. **SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**: SARIMA incorporates autoregressive and moving average terms, along with seasonal components, to capture complex patterns in time series data. It's highly versatile and can handle various types of data.

6. **SARIMAX (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Variables)**: SARIMAX extends SARIMA by allowing the inclusion of external variables that may influence the time series. This makes it suitable for modeling financial data influenced by multiple factors.

# [Data Dictionary](#section-title)

The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout this project and are defined as follows:

| Item | Description
| --- | --- 
| **date** | *The date at which TSLA's closing price was recorded*
| **close** | *The last price at which a security trades during a regular trading session. (For U.S. markets, regular trading sessions run from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.)*
| **volume** | *the number of shares traded in a given periodof time (aka: trading volume)*

# [Discussion & Recommendations](#section-title)

The discussion of each model is embedded within the code provided. Each model was compared on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), as well as other parameters such as AIC and BIC when applicable. The model with the lowest RMSE and AIC/BIC is considered to be the model with the most predictive power.  Recommendations for next steps are to continue building out the time series forecasting with a SARIMAX model to incorprate exogenous factor(s) such as economic indicators or environmental variables and to reference the sentiment analysis and NLTK results to provide insight to hot topics that may also cause TSLA price movement.
